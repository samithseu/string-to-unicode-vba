# String To Unicde For VBA

This is a simple script that converts a string to unicode code in VBA.

I created this because VBA doesn't support Khmer language, so I had to convert the string to unicode code.

## Usage

Go to this site: <https://samithseu.github.io/string-to-unicode-vba> and put whatever string you want to convert!
